So I've just got back from my family's yearly trip to Vinpearl Nha Trang yesterday, and this is why I was more excited about the food than the trip itself.

For starters, Dad continues to do the kind of threatening and disagreeing about everything that I suggested. for example, I specifically wanted to carry a backpack because it is a very short vacation that lasts only 2 nights. But dad REALLY seem to want me to carry a suitcase because it had wheels so that I can pull my baggage instead of having to carry it on my shoulders. And for the WHOLE FUCKING NIGHT, Dad keeps muttering how I'm so "stupid" for thinking that.

I mean, in my defense, carrying a backpack is much more convenient on a short trip, like, the only stuff I'm bringing is a few set of clothes
