Today is my first day writing in a journal again because I don't really have that much time on my hands, so now that it is the end of my freshman year, I'm gonna write a little recap of what happened during said year.

When I started the year, the whole first week is dedicated to this big meeting where they introduce you to all the nooks and crannies of the university, such as the facilities, clubs, activities, the rubric, etc. Then I started out studying calculus, linear algebra, introduction to CS and introduction to programming. I remember absolutely acing the first part of programming introduction because I knew a bit of C++ at the time and some people have zero knowledge in programming at all.
